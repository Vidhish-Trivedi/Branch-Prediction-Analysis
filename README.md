# Branch-Prediction-Analysis
A program to analyze branch prediction policies.  
In this project, we explore the effectiveness of various branch prediction policies.  
A binary instrumentation tool is used to generate a trace of branches and their outcomes (file0).  
We then use this representative trace to evaluate the effectiveness of a few branch prediction schemes seen as part of EG211-Computer Architecture course.
